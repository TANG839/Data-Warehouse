I created the datasources using SQL server. Then I extract the data from datasources, 
clean them and loaded them into data warehouse. This is the ETL project which I finished. 
Finally, I made an SSAS project using Visual Studio and retrieved in the cube and 
visualize it with Excel and Power BI.# Data-Warehouse
